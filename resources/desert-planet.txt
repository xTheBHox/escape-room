!DunesVisit|The landing is turbulent.
!DunesVisit|As the sand settles, I see there is
!DunesVisit|nobody here to meet me.
DunesVisit|There is still nobody here to meet me.
 
WontLeave|Something remains to accomplish. I won't leave.

!OasisVisit|I search east, walking in ever-greater
!OasisVisit|circles. Just over the next dune, I find
!OasisVisit|an oasis.
OasisVisit|The oasis sparkles in the sunlight.
 
!TookStone|Glinting in the glass-clear water is a
!TookStone|single blue gemstone.
TookStone|The stone fits snugly in my pocket.

!HillVisit|I set off confidently to the west.
!HillVisit|At the top of the third dune, a circle
!HillVisit|of stones surrounds a shallow depression
!HillVisit|in the ground.
 
!AddedStone|The circle of stones stands expectantly.
AddedStone|I add the blue stone to the circle.
AddedStone|Something trembles deep underground.
